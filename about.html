        <h3>My name is Christian Furl G. Tujan and i am the maker of this website. I would like to first thank you for visiting my website and exploring it. I am a student from the University of San Carlos, 
            and i am currently in my first year of college studying BS-IT. I originally lived and graduated highschool in Ormoc City in Leyte at Saint Paul's School of Ormoc. I made this website so that the 
            compilation of my portfolio can easily be accessed in one place. Its works, its convenient, and its fast so it is really amazing to use. I began having interest on making websites at like grade 5 when
            html was introduced to us as very basic concepts, not going to in dept about it. Then in later years we began tackling about it again but more in dept so i became more interested, so grade 10 happened
            and on grade 10 was the first time that css was introduced to us in a more in dept manner so i got even more interested and this was the time that my brain really said that i just loved making websites
            and just technology entirely, and this was the time that i started becoming really serious about taking IT for college as i wanted to become and engineer before. So i guess all of that interest carried
            over into grade 12 where i finally made the final decision to purse IT for college after our work immersion as it was what finalized my decision as i got to see and experience some of what IT people do 
            on a daily. I thought to myself that i really am meant to pursue this program as really have fun doing things such as making websites, programming, basically fidling with a lot of technology and having fun 
            while doing it. And now here i am now stuying in college and doing the things that i love doing, that is my story.</h3>
